Pair: E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ)

Simple pair trading strategy:

       Asset Selection: Choose two highly correlated assets for your pair trading strategy. In this case, the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and the E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ) are both stock index futures contracts and are known to have a strong positive correlation.

       Calculate the spread: Calculate the spread between the two assets by taking the difference of their prices. The spread can be calculated as Spread = ES Price - NQ Price.

       Historical Average and Standard Deviation: Calculate the historical average and standard deviation of the spread over a specified period (e.g. 20 days) to establish a baseline. This will help identify deviations from the mean.

       Entry Criteria: Define entry criteria based on the standard deviations of the spread. For example, if the spread moves more than a certain number of standard deviations from the mean, it could signal an opportunity for a pair trade. You can set a threshold, such as entering a trade when the spread exceeds two standard deviations from the mean.

       Entry Strategy: When the spread crosses the predefined threshold, open a pair trade by shorting the relatively overvalued asset and buying the relatively undervalued asset. In this case, if the spread is wide (above two standard deviations), you would sell short E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and buy E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ).

       Exit strategy: define an exit strategy to close the pair trade. This can be based on mean reversion or a predetermined profit target. For example, you can exit the trade when the spread returns to within one standard deviation of the mean or when a specified profit target is met.

       Risk Management: Implement risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses should the trade move against you. Determine the appropriate position size and overall risk exposure based on your risk tolerance.

       Monitoring and adjustments: continuously monitor the spread between the two assets and adjust the position if necessary. If the spread widens further or deviates from the average, you may consider changing the trade or closing it entirely.

Remember, this is a simplified example of a pair trading strategy using the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and the E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ). It is important to conduct thorough research, backtest and consider other factors such as liquidity, transaction costs and market conditions before implementing any trading strategy.
